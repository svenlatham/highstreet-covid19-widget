## High Street Covid-19 Reporter

This is a simple tool for showing how busy your High Street is, and when the best times to visit might be.

You can see a sample on the [demo page](https://svenlatham.github.io/highstreet-covid19-widget/).

### Installation

Open the page you want to edit, and add the following code:

```markdown
<div id="highstreetwidget" data-source="https://svenlatham.github.io/highstreet-covid19-widget/sample.csv"></div>
<script defer src="https://svenlatham.github.io/highstreet-covid19-widget/widget.js?src=123"></script>
```

Replace data-source with your footfall data


### Sample


<div id="highstreetwidget" data-source="https://svenlatham.github.io/highstreet-covid19-widget/sample.csv"></div>
<script defer src="https://svenlatham.github.io/highstreet-covid19-widget/widget.js?src=123"></script>

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
